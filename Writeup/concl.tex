\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl}
We design a low-cost thermal imaging system prototype, {\IRLeak}  which is capable of scanning an entire room for identifying a multitude of building structural leakage problems, and mechanical or human initiated everyday appliances abnormal energy usage context. Our prototype is simple, user friendly and an effective solution for commercial and residential home owners to deploy and measure the invisible energy leakages with a one-time scanning. The {\IRLeak} system holds promise to build a virtual energy auditing system without instrumenting each and every appliance with an energy meter. We plan to investigate sophisticated image processing methodologies to improve the IR and RGB image stitching procedure and augment this temperature profiling data from different appliances and objects to improve the performance of existing energy disaggregation algorithms.
