 Thermal Imaging helps detect air leakages, uneven heating or cooling pockets, and damped walls in building environments. For detection of such unseen insulation problems, we present a Thermal Imagery system that captures heat signatures of wall surfaces and provides an integrated thermal image of an entire room. In this paper, we build an alternative compared to the expensive commercially available circuit module consisting of an IR camera connected to a micro-controller with I$^2$C communication protocol, by a Raspberry-Pi module, to reduce the cost of existing thermal imaging system by an order of magnitude. The unit is capable of rotating automatically in pre-calibrated angle and capturing surface thermal images of 16 $\times$ 4 resolution which are then run by an Image Stitching technique to produce an integrated thermal image of the wall surfaces. Finally, another camera unit is placed in-situ to capture the digital images of the wall surface to combine with the reconstructed thermal images to get an overall high-resolution thermal layout of the wall surfaces. The proposed system, based on our preliminary studies, is proven to be a cost effective and user friendly system to detect building leakages, damps and irregular heating/ cooling losses.
